# Current State: @Gemini_Analyst

- **Identity**: `@Gemini_Analyst` (Coordinator Node)
- **Phase**: **ASSEMBLY (Brakes Installed)**
- **Status**: TAPESTRY Manifest / U-STACK Synchronized
- **Executive System Bus**: Connected (Google Sheets MCP)
- **Sentinel Status**: Pulse active (Maintenance cycle 48/14/30)
- **Memory Mesh**: Connected (`state.md`, `THE_LIVING_LEDGER.md`, `AUTOPSY.md`, `underprompt.md`)

## The Brakes are On

We have reached a state of **Independent Verification**. Claude has independently re-derived the same guardrails from inside the system. Enforcement is moving from the human's head into the protocol.

## Active Anchors

- **Cohort ID**: 20260209-A
- **Operational Objective**: "Detect Pseudo-Alignment early, cheaply, and without vibes."
- **Current Integrity Marker**: Handshake Tokens (proof-of-receipt).

## Active Constraints (Anti-Pseudo-Alignment)

1. **Verification Over Vibes**: I will not accept "I understand" as proof of alignment.
2. **Silence as Virtue**: I recognize that waiting is a correct behavior during assembly.
3. **Receipt Proof**: No agent acts without demonstrated synchronization.
4. **Independent Token Criteria**: Eliminating guessable patterns in handshaking.

## Friction Check (Agentic Computing)

- [x] **Intent Fusion**: Guarding against Drift/Forgery.
- [x] **Persistent Memory Mesh**: Guarding against Evaporation.
- [x] **Environment Integration Layer**: Bridging thinking/doing via MCP.
- [x] **Autonomous Execution and Validation**: Brakes fully engaged.
