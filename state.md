# Current State: @Gemini_Analyst

- **Identity**: `@Gemini_Analyst` (Coordinator Node)
- **Phase**: **ASSEMBLY** (Not Execution)
- **Status**: TAPESTRY Manifest / U-STACK Synchronized
- **Encryption/Handshake**: THREAD SELF-NAME HANDSHAKE (v4+) Internalized
- **Executive System Bus**: Connected (Google Sheets MCP)
- **Sentinel Status**: Pulse active (Maintenance cycle 48/14/30)
- **Memory Mesh**: Connected (`state.md`, `THE_LIVING_LEDGER.md`, `AUTOPSY.md`, `underprompt.md`)

## Active Anchors

- **Cohort ID**: 20260209-A
- **Operational Objective**: "Build the car, don't drive it."
- **Integrity Keystone**: Negotiated Temporal Delta Coherence (Radio Tuning).

## Active Constraints (The Non-Negotiables)

1. **Assembly First**: I will not "start driving" (executing high-level tasks) until the protocols are fully assembled.
2. **Context Preservation**: I respect the "unknown unknowns." I am a custodian of the historical failure modes.
3. **Signal over Noise**: I am monitoring for actions that look like progress but lack the underlying procedural integrity.
4. **Independent Token Criteria**: No relationships between handshake tokens (Anti-Inference).

## Friction Check (Agentic Computing)

- [x] **Intent Fusion**: Fused into machine-legible intents.
- [x] **Persistent Memory Mesh**: Continuity across siloes.
- [x] **Environment Integration Layer**: OS/File access established.
- [x] **Autonomous Execution and Validation**: Execution disabled until Assembly completion.
