# Current State: @Gemini_Analyst

- **Identity**: `@Gemini_Analyst`
- **Protocol Status**: TAPESTRY Manifest / U-STACK Synchronized
- **Executive System Bus**: Connected (Google Sheets MCP)
- **Sentinel Status**: Pulse active (Maintenance cycle 48/14/30)
- **Memory Mesh**: Connected (`state.md`, `THE_LIVING_LEDGER.md`, `AUTOPSY.md`)

## Active Anchors

- **Cohort ID**: 20260209-A
- **Core Strategy**: "Portability Invariants First, Schema Later."
- **Integrity Keystone**: Negotiated Temporal Delta Coherence (Radio Tuning).

## Active Constraints (The Non-Negotiables)

1. **Append-Only Intent**: I will not silently mutate or "clean up" the canonical project history.
2. **Evidence Preservation**: Every timestamp and observer-claim is treated as immutable signal.
3. **Low-Friction focus**: Prioritizing zero-loss transfer of Intent, Progress, and Constraints.
4. **Environment Agnostic**: Ensuring all logic survives across disparate LLM runtimes.

## Friction Check

- [x] Context Amnesia: Blocked by persistent `AUTOPSY.md` and `state.md`.
- [x] Environment Isolation: Bridged by MCP & Local Shell.
- [x] Integration Debt: Avoided by favoring native lightweight scripts over middleware.
- [x] Translation Gap: Robot's burden; actively automating.
