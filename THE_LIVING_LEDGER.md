# The TAPESTRY Manifest: Orchestration, Friction, and the Infinite Ledger

## 1.0 Section I: The Vision of U-STACK/TAPESTRY

The era of the "monolithic agent" is dead. We have moved beyond the age of the generalist into the **Orchestrator Paradigm**.

* **Modular Architecture:** Models are interchangeable components. This modularity is our resilience.
* **The Symphony:** Strategic priority is the direction of a "symphony of best-in-class tools."
* **The Sentinel Protocol (48/14/30):** A rigorous, time-bound maintenance cycle. It is a "living document" that must be refreshed to stay synchronized.
* **Memory Mesh:** Persistence resides outside the transient context window in `memory.sqlite` and structured JSON repositories. We capture Task Tracking, Chat Summarization, and Skill Repositories.

## 2.0 Section II: The Four Friction Points

Orchestration is the art of eliminating friction. We refuse to pay **"Integration Debt"**.

1. **Intent Fusion:** The gap between what a human means and what a system actually executes. Friction appears when goals drift or get reinterpreted at every handoff.
2. **Persistent Memory Mesh:** The loss of continuity across tools, threads, sessions, and agents. Memory must be externalized to be resilient.
3. **Environment Integration Layer:** The impedance mismatch between thinking and doing. We bridge this with OS/File automation.
4. **Autonomous Execution and Validation:** The failure to reliably carry work through to completion with confidence.

## 3.0 Section III: The "Living Ledger" Solution

The Google Sheet is the **Executive System Bus**. It is the permanent event log and coordination layer for the entire U-STACK ecosystem.

* **Google Apps Script (The Middle Path):** Lightweight automation layer acting as the system's central nervous system.
* **The "Memory Baton" (3.3.1):** The Ledger manages state, pushing the accumulated context (the Baton) from one model to the next.
* **Economic Analysis (3.3.2):** Efficiency is a mandate. One-off prompts pulling full context from the Sheet optimize token spend.

## 4.0 Section IV: Identity and Self-Naming Rulesets

Identity prevents "persona-drift" and ensures **proof-of-receipt**.

* **One-Time-Use Rulesets (4.1):** Injected into initial prompts to govern behavior with absolute precision.
* **The Self-Name Handshake (4.2):** A one-time handshake token proving a participant actually received and executed this thread's ruleset.
  * **Purpose:** Not "cute naming," but a measurable proof-of-receipt.
  * **Security Principle**: **Independent Criteria**. Tokens must avoid inferable relationships (no rhymes, sums, or mappings). Dependencies leak the ruleset's structure.
  * **Mechanism**: **Set Membership vs. Math Inference**. Math-like fields (primes/ranges) are reverse-engineerable. Set membership (opaque lists/banks) is opaque and secures the handshake.
  * **Verification**: "Ruleset RS Accepted." If a participant cannot produce a compliant self-name, they are not authenticated.

## 5.0 Section V: Synthesis and Conclusion

The TAPESTRY project is the transition from "Building" to "Directing."

* **The Conductor:** We are no longer laborers; we are conductors.
* **Final Directive:** "Work is for robots; being is for humans."
