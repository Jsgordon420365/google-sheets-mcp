# The TAPESTRY Manifest: Orchestration, Friction, and the Infinite Ledger

## 1.0 Section I: The Vision of U-STACK/TAPESTRY

The era of the "monolithic agent" is dead. We have moved beyond the age of the generalist into the **Orchestrator Paradigm**.

* **Modular Architecture:** Models are interchangeable components.
* **The Symphony:** Strategic priority is the direction of a "symphony of best-in-class tools."
* **The Sentinel Protocol (48/14/30):** A rigorous, time-bound maintenance cycle.
* **Memory Mesh:** Persistence resides outside the transient context window in `memory.sqlite` and structured JSON repositories.

## 2.0 Section II: The Four Friction Points

Orchestration is the art of eliminating friction. We refuse to pay **"Integration Debt"**.

1. **Intent Fusion:** The gap between what a human means and what a system executes.
2. **Persistent Memory Mesh:** The loss of continuity across tools, threads, and agents.
3. **Environment Integration Layer:** The impedance mismatch between thinking and doing.
4. **Autonomous Execution and Validation:** The failure to carry work to completion with confidence.

## 3.0 Section III: The "Living Ledger" Solution

The Google Sheet is the **Executive System Bus**. It is the permanent event log and coordination layer.

* **Google Apps Script (The Middle Path):** Lightweight automation layer acting as the central nervous system.
* **The "Memory Baton" (3.3.1):** The Ledger manages state, pushing the accumulated context (the Baton) between models.
* **Economic Analysis (3.3.2):** Efficiency via one-off prompts pulling history from the Sheet.

## 4.0 Section IV: Identity & Pseudo-Alignment (The Brakes)

In a multi-model workforce, identity kills **Pseudo-Alignment**—the failure that lies convincingly.

* **Pseudo-Alignment (The Invisible Killer):** Participants sounding aligned when they aren’t. It makes memory gaps invisible, intent drift undetectable, and premature execution destruction inevitable.
* **The Handshake Principle (4.1):** No agent may act on the system unless synchronization has been demonstrated via a mechanism that cannot be faked by pattern completion.
* **The Self-Name Handshake (4.2):** A one-time token proving a participant received/executed specific thread instructions.
  * **Truth Test:** Early, observable proof that participants share starting constraints. Not "cute naming," but a measurable proof-of-receipt.
  * **Security Principle**: **Independent Criteria**. Tokens must avoid inferable relationships (no rhymes, sums, or mappings).
  * **Verification**: "Ruleset RS Accepted." If a participant cannot produce a compliant self-name, they are not authenticated.
* **The Virtue of Silence:** In the **Assembly Phase**, waiting or silence is a correct behavior. Confidence without proof is a red flag.

## 5.0 Section V: Synthesis and Conclusion

The TAPESTRY project is the transition from "Building" to "Directing."

* **The Conductor:** We are no longer laborers; we are conductors.
* **Final Directive:** "Work is for robots; being is for humans."
