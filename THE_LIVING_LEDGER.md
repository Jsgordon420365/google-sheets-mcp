# The TAPESTRY Manifest: Orchestration, Friction, and the Infinite Ledger

## 1.0 Section I: The Vision of U-STACK/TAPESTRY

The era of the "monolithic agent" is dead. We have moved beyond the age of the generalist into the **Orchestrator Paradigm**.

* **Modular Architecture:** Models are interchangeable components. This modularity is our resilience.
* **The Symphony:** Strategic priority is the direction of a "symphony of best-in-class tools."
* **The Sentinel Protocol (48/14/30):** A rigorous, time-bound maintenance cycle. It is a "living document" that must be refreshed to stay synchronized.
* **Memory Mesh:** Persistence resides outside the transient context window in `memory.sqlite` and structured JSON repositories. We capture:
    1. Task Tracking
    2. Chat Summarization
    3. Skill Repositories

## 2.0 Section II: The Four Friction Points

Orchestration is the art of eliminating friction. We refuse to pay **"Integration Debt."**

1. **Context Amnesia (2.3.1):** Systemic failure of memory between sessions. We demand a system that picks up the thread exactly where it was left.
2. **Environment Isolation (2.3.2):** LLMs imprisoned in browser tabs. We bridge this with terminal automation (zsh, bash wrappers like `run_ts_script.sh`).
3. **Integration Debt (2.3.3):** Fragile third-party middleware is a liability. We prioritize native tools and lightweight, local scripts.
4. **The Translation Gap (2.3.4):** Manual waste of human "being" on low-level data munging. Data conversion is a robot's burden.

## 3.0 Section III: The "Living Ledger" Solution

The Google Sheet is the **Executive System Bus**. It is the permanent event log and coordination layer for the entire U-STACK ecosystem.

* **Google Apps Script (The Middle Path):** Lightweight automation layer acting as the system's central nervous system.
* **The "Memory Baton" (3.3.1):** Solves continuity issues. The Ledger manages state, pushing the accumulated context (the Baton) from one model to the next.
* **Economic Analysis (3.3.2):** Efficiency is a mandate. One-off prompts pulling full context from the Sheet optimize token spend.

## 4.0 Section IV: Identity and Self-Naming Rulesets

In a multi-model workforce, identity prevents "persona-drift."

* **One-Time-Use Rulesets (4.1):** Injected into initial prompts to govern behavior with absolute precision (e.g., `<s>[INST]` or SYSTEM instructions).
* **Self-Naming Protocol (4.2):** Rigid functional identities (e.g., `@Claude_Architect`, `@GPT_Coder`, `@Gemini_Analyst`).
* **Orchestrating the Debate (4.3):** Facilitating a "Zero-Trust" environment. Models output to specific cells and debate/cross-examine one another within the Ledger.

## 5.0 Section V: Synthesis and Conclusion

The TAPESTRY project is the transition from "Building" to "Directing."

* **The Conductor:** We are no longer laborers; we are conductors.
* **Final Directive:** "Work is for robots; being is for humans."
